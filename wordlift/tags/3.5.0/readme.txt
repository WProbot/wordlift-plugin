== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why shall I use WordLift? = 

Throwing content online without context and analysis simply doesn’t work when the focus for digital news is on *interactivity*, *engagement* and *community*. <br />
**WordLift** organizes knowledge, **reducing the complexity of content management and digital marketing operations**, letting bloggers and site owner **focus on stories and communities**. It offers meaningful *cross-media discovery* and *recommendations* that **increases content quality, exposure, trustworthiness and readership engagement**. <br />
**WordLift** also publishes *linked data* as a new way to syndicate content and create new business models. <br />


= How does it work? =

**WordLift** is a semantic editor and works in subsequent stages. The first step provides a full text analysis and suggests entities and relationships to the user, classifying contents according to concepts stored in the *semantic graph* (DBpedia, Wikidata, GeoNames, etc.) and using schema.org vocabulary. Textual contents are structured: they can now be processed by machines and be connected to other datasets. Users can then create new entities, to complement the entities suggested automatically and form a proprietary vocabulary, according to the editorial plan. <br />

**WordLift** provides means to record all these relationships in a graph database combining structured, semistructured and unstructured data, which allows queries like *“find all contents related to concept_y and relevant for target_z”*. <br />
